# Why we made this??  <br></br>

We made ‘Solace’ to bridge the gap between our healthcare system and the people facing difficulties in accessing medical services by providing a hassle free, easy-to-use platform. Our team tries its best to reach as many people as possible and help them in any way we can. We hope to increase the medical awareness amongst the people, especially in the rural areas. Our esteemed college and the amazing faculties inspired us to make a project that stands out, so we created ‘Solace’ in the hopes that we can help our society. <br></br>
We did a lot of research and hard work to tailor in some very useful features into our website so that it could benefit people as much as possible. And we won’t stop just there. We aim to take reviews and suggestions from our users and keep on improving our website so that it can solve as many problems as possible and bring a smile on people’s faces. Solace is a helping hand towards your radiant health and we at ‘Solace’ strive to work for the betterment of the healthcare system and help as many people as possible. <br></br>
